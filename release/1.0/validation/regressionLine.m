function [m,c,err]=regressionLine(x,y)
% 
% [m,c,err] = regressionLine(x,y)
% 
% fits a straight line to some data by minimizing the sum of squared
% y distances between the data and the fitted line.
% 
% Input:
%   x,y: data points to be fitted.
% Output:
%   m,c: slope and y-intercept of the fitted line y=m*x+c.
%   err: the y-distances between the data points and the fitted line.
